🔬 Cell Counting & Cell Segmentation

---

GOAL: CELL COUNTING WITH DEEP LEARNING

Deep learning will be used to count the number of cells surviving an intervention (e.g., anticancer compound application). This automates tracking of living cells.

DATA SOURCE

Source: Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC005_v1_ground_truth)

The cells from the data set are Cell Lines: lab-cultivated cells grown stably from a given source.

Image Format: NumPy array: (i images, N height, M width, 3 RGB)

Each image filename contains the experimental variables, which are extracted to define the dataset.
Example Structure: SIMCEPImages\_well\_Ccells\_Fblur\_ssamples\_wstain.TIF

well: Standard 384-well plate format (Rows A-P, Cols 1-24).
cells: Number of cells in the image. (Range: 1-100)
blur: Amount of focus blur applied. (Range: 1-48)
sample: Number of samples. (Range: 1-25)
stain: Stain type (1=Cell Body, 2=Nuclei). (Range: 1 or 2).

We can interpolate the filename to extract each files' cells value and use that as
each records target. By analyzing the content of each image, the model can
learn what a cells looks like and how to count them.
