Cell Counting & Cell Segmentation

---

GOAL: CELL COUNTING WITH DEEP LEARNING
Deep learning is used to count the number of cells surviving an intervention (e.g., anticancer compound application).
This automates tracking of living cells.

DATA SOURCE: BBBC005_v1_ground_truth
Source: Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection.
Image Format: NumPy array, usually (i images, N height, M width, 3 RGB).

---

DATA COLLECTION CONTEXT: FILENAME METADATA

The cells from the data set are Cell Lines: lab-cultivated cells grown stably from a given source.
Each image filename contains the cells experimental variables.
Example Structure: SIMCEPImages_well_Ccells_Fblur_ssamples_wstain.TIF

VARIABLES:
well: 384-well plate format (Rows A-P, Cols 1-24).
cells: NUMBER OF CELLS IN THE IMAGE. (Range: 1-100)
blur: Amount of focus blur applied. (Range: 1-48)
sample: Number of samples. (Range: 1-25)
stain: Stain type (1=Cell Body, 2=Nuclei). (Range: 1 or 2)

The 'cells' variable is the target output (y) for the cell counting model.
